## DEPLOYMENT RULES / GUIDELINES

Never push directly to the defualt branches.
- production
- staging
- development

For every change to the codebase, no matter how tiny, create a new branch for it, work on that branch and push to it, then make a pull request from that branch to the development branch.
Staging and Production branches are out of bounds and should never be pushed to or make a pull request against them.

Steps To Create a Pull Request:

- Click on the issue assigned to you, at the left side, you see a create branch text button, click on it, and copy the git command there and run it in the root folder of haulk front end git repository.

- Run 'git push' to publish the branch to the remote (haulk front end repo) repository.

- Work on that branch and do what your issue ticket tells you to do

- Once you are done, create a pull request from that branch to the development branch.

## DEVELOPEMENT RULES / GUIDELINES WRITING SERVER CODES

### 01. Comment your code very well

Writing a difficult piece of code where itâ€™s difficult to understand what you are doing and, most of all, why? Never forget to comment it. This will become extremely useful for everyone and to your future self.

### 02. Keep an eye on your file sizes

Files that are has long codes are extremely hard to manage and maintain. Always keep an eye on code length in a file, and if they become too long, try to split them into modules packed in a folder as files that are related together.

### 03. Anything/Everything that is likely to vary between deploys (staging, production, developer environments, etc). Should be added to .ENV. Do not store config as constants in the code. This is a violation of twelve-factor, which requires strict separation of config from code. Config varies substantially across deploys, code does not.

### 04. Naming Convention

When naming a variable, use camelCase. When naming a function, use camelCase. When naming a class, use PascalCase. When naming a module, use PascalCase. lets try to avoid a_b_c naming convention, it makes code harder to read.
